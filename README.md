# RL Gym Environments
This project contains a single ipynb file meant to be ran in google colab.
It is a sequence of solutions for training agents to solve different Reinforcement
Learning Environments

The steps for setup are:
1. Download python notebook from repository
2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ (you will need a google account)
3. Upload the notebook (you can go to the file tab and there should be an upload option)
4. Run imports section first (if there are errors that pop up, just go to runtime tap and click restart runtime)
5. Now you can go to any of the three sections and run through the code for solving that specific enironment

Notes:
1. Imports MUST BE RAN BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE (this includes the installs too)
2. Each environment has its own section (the name of the environment for the section will be at the top), and you must run everything within a section in order
3. Certain variable names are shared between different sections (because they had the same function in each section), so if you go to one section and then another, you have to re-run all code in order within the prior section to make sure nothing gets mixed up
4. The training for Checkers can take a couple hours, so be aware of this if you try to run it
